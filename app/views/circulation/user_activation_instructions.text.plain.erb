Hey, you!

Congratulations, you've been granted access to the Hot Ink development demo. 

It's important to keep in mind that this installation is FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY and is meant as
both a simple demo for interested publishers and as a way for those following the system to keep up-to-date
on the latest development progress. ANY ACCOUNT ON THIS SERVER MAY BE DELETED AT ANY TIME. It's not personal,
it's just that occasionally we need to wipe the server's database to install new features. If you've lost
access to the demo and would like to get it back, email chris@hotink.net.

Feel free to use any of the features, upload any file you like or save any article you like. Keep in mind that
SOME FEATURES MAY BE UNSTABLE. Again, it's not personal, it's just that occasionally we'll push a new feature
for testing before implementing all the parts and pieces. If something you like is not working, or if you need 
access to a broken or disabled feature for internal demonstration purposes, email chris@hotink.net and we'll try
to help you out.

In order to get inside, follow the link below (or paste it into your browser address bar.)

Thanks for your early interest in Hot Ink.

Rob, Chris, Andrew and Mark

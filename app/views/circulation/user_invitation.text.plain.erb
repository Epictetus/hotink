Hey, you!

Congratulations, you've been granted access to Canadian University Press's 
web-publishing and newswire software, known as Hot Ink. 

For now, you'll be able to log in, view, edit and upload articles, media or
print issues for your campus paper. If appropriate, one of your Account Managers 
can give you access to the management interface of the system. If you think that 
you should be an Account Manager, but after logging in you find you don't have 
access to your account's management interface, please email chris@hotink.net.

In order to get inside, follow the link below (or paste it into your browser 
address bar.)

<%= @edit_invitation_url %>

Once you've activated your user account, you can log into the admin area for your
publication by visiting <%= @admin_url %>.

Thanks for your interest in Hot Ink.

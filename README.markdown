# MassData

This project, under the working title **MassData**, is one half of a RESTful, cross-media, content management and distribution program created by [CUP](http://www.cup.ca) and [Campus Plus](http://www.campusplus.com).

**MassData** handles data upload, storage and organization. It will include all the necessary interface components for posting new content, navigating through and editing of existing content, and sharing content with other papers via the CUP newswire.

In addition to making **MassData** content available to the view applications created for the CUPwire and campus paper publishing, this project will also make it possible for other content management systems to easily and RESTfully post their content to **MassData** and the CUP newswire using a clear API. As well, papers wishing to use **MassData** as a data storage and management application are free to build their own view applications around the API, allowing developers the freedom to focus on developing a customized view application while avoiding concerns about data management.

Volunteers interested in getting involved in the development of the system are encouraged to create a branch and begin working. After database config, this applciation should work fine for testing and development purposes. 

**KEEP IN MIND**: This project is still under development and NOT ready for general use. Hang in there, though

## HotInk Publisher

[HotInk Publisher](http://github.com/HotInk/hotink-publisher) is a publishing system designed for newspapers that will fetch and display content from **MassData**.
